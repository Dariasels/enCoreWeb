# My website project: technical and personal challange

GOAL:
The core idea is to run half marathons around the world with friends, and people I meet on my trips. Working towards the same goals and seeing eachother with a common purpose stregnthens relationships. This idea quickly expanded to hiking, backpacking trips, as well as diving and skiing trips. This website is a place for everyone to share trips ideas, tips, and stay updated.
Creating a website for me has been an technical challange for to learn to code and to use GitHub, and therefore I purpusfully didn't vibecode it.
