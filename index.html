      <h2>
        Short introduction:</h2>
          <div class="intro"> 
            <p>If you're reading this you probably know who I am.</p>       
            <p>I am that random girl who never stops thinking about leaving Belgium :) (That probably explains why you met me in a different country:)</p>
            
            <p>his website is an accumulation of many of my passions, inspirations, and plans.It's both a technical project to me (to learn to code, host, and manage a website), as well as a life-long personal project to organize my travel ideas and share them with friends.</p>
            
            <p>I intend to live life the fullest with the poeple I care about, that drive me and that want to explore the world together.</p>

            <p>Here you'll find different types of trips that I want to organize, share, and experience with you.
            Each trip page contains more information about the trip type, and allows you to sign up so that you can stay up to date with the latest plans.</p>
            In either case, once you sign up, you will be notified about a new event.
            If you see anything that you like, please hit the 'I'm in' button and get notified about your event. 
            Then, let's embrark on this adventure together!</p>

            <p>This project is constantly evolving, so feel free to give me feeback at anytime.
            Also, if you have any trip ideas, please post them on the 'Suggestions' page.
            And, if you have tips about a certain topic (like 'whats the best running gel', 'in which month should you visit the salt lakes in bolivia', or ' how do I train for a marathon'), please share them on the 'Inspiration' page, so that I can put them online.</p>

            <p>There's only one rule, be part of the community once you sign up, and let's make core memories together!</p>

        <a href="running.html">Running Trips</a>
      </h2>
      <p> Main goal at the moment: Let's run the world together!!! From the Pyramids of Egypt to the Great Wall of China, let's see these places without tourists:)
        Come with us to run half marathons around the world. </p>

      </h2>
      <p>After climbing a 6000m volcano, I kind of got in the ban of hiking. Mountains are a great inspiration source to me and doing hiking adventures is something I aspire to do.</p>

        <a href="backpacking.html">Backpacking Trips</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I will for sure do a couple of multi-month backpack trips during my lifetime. I want to post them here and allow friends to join me on parts of the trip.
        If you plan to go backpacking for a couple of months, feel free to post in online if you want people to join certain parts!

        <a href="diving.html">Diving Trips</a>
      </h2>
      <p>It speaks for itself that since our diving community is expanding, diving adventures will become an amazing thing to share among friends. 
        (For example combine diving in egypt with the half marathon next to the pyramids, or skiing in japan, and then flying to an island to dive" -- everything is possible)</p>

        <a href="food.html">Food Trips</a>
      </h2>
      <p>I'm not going to lie, many of the trips I partake in are about food. So yes, on these trips here, we'll just eat good food, soak up the culture, and relax.</p>
